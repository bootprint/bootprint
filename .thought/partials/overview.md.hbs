`Bootprint` is a tool for converting JSON-files into static HTML-pages using [{less}](http://lesscss.org),
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com).

It is designed with flexibility in mind:

* You can easily modify the styling by providing your own {less}-files.
* You can easily replace the Handlebars template and any register partial
* You can include custom handlebars-helpers or override existing ones.
* You can create packages with default-configurations, publish them on [npm](http://npmjs.org)
and use them as base for further customizations.
